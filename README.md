# MroUnicode

"Mro Unicode" is a font for the Mro script used by the Mro (sometimes "Mru") people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in southeastern Bangladesh.

The Mro script has not yet been added to Unicode, but a proposal for encoding has been accepted. This font accordingly uses this encoding, described in [Proposal N3589][prop1] and clarified in [Proposal 4010][prop2]. (Apparently the two punctuation marks given were not initially accepted and so required further defense.) The Unicode ["Pipeline"][uni1] shows this proposal is at Stage 7 -- the penultimate stage -- and so probably will not be modified. If it is modified this font will be altered accordingly.

"Mro Unicode" appears to be the first publicly available font which covers this proposed Unicode block.

Adobe's open source font ["Source Sans Pro"][ssp] provides the Latin script counterpart for the font and the base for the Mro design.
